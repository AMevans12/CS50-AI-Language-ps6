# CS50 AI Week 6: Language Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two projects from Week 6 of the CS50 AI course, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and neural network mechanisms. The projects are designed to deepen understanding of language models and attention mechanisms.

## Projects

### 1. Parser

The Parser project involves building a natural language parser to analyze and interpret sentences. The goal is to identify the grammatical structure of sentences, including parts of speech and syntactic relationships.

#### Key Features:
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Assigning parts of speech to each token.
- **Syntactic Parsing:** Constructing a parse tree to represent the grammatical structure.

### 2. Attention

The Attention project explores the implementation of attention mechanisms in neural networks. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving performance in tasks like translation and text generation.

#### Key Features:
- **Attention Mechanism:** Implementing the attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different parts of the input.
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Model:** Using attention in sequence-to-sequence models for tasks like machine translation.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance on relevant NLP tasks.
